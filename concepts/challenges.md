# Challenges

Challenges are a mechanism to engage members by challenging them to perform some interesting activities.

Challenges are a type of program content and refer to [content guide](./content) to understand:

* Challenge display
* Challenge eligibility
* Challenge lifecycle

## Challenge Status, Effectivity, and Assignees
Change the **status** of a challenge to change the visibility of the challenge to members:

* *Draft:* Members cannot view the challenge. Edit the challenge on the console in *draft* mode.

* *Published:* Members can view the challenge and are eligible to enter. You are restricted from editing some characteristics of the challenge (such as *challenge type*) after members enter it.

* *Archived:* Members can no longer view the challenge and are ineligible to enter. A challenge becomes archived when the time frame given for the challenge effectivity ends. You can still view all archived challenges on the console.

Change the **effectivity** of a challenge to designate the time frame for which members can view and enter the challenge:

* *Always:* The challenge is always visible to members until manually archived.

* *Schedule:* Customize the time frame that the challenge is active. Includes the capability to have recurring challenges.

Choose an **assignee** for a challenge in order to give ownership or responsibility for the challenge to one or more team members. You can easily find the tasks assigned to a specific person by searching for a name in the Challenge search bar.

## Sorting Challenges
### Challenge Categories
Use the Challenge | Settings | Challenge Categories screen to define categories to organize different types of challenges. Add challenges to a category you have created by editing the *Categories* section of a specific challenge.

### Challenge Tags and Tracking Code
Give challenges tags and a unique tracking code to differentiate challenges for internal use.

### Challenge Segments
Use the Challenge | Segments screen to specify one or more eligible segments for each challenge. Use segmentation to target a specific demographic with the challenge by including or excluding segments to be eligible for the challenge. View the Members | Segments page to create member segments.

## Challenge Types
### Photo Challenge
Ask members to enter a photo with desired characteristics. Edit the response settings for the photo challenge under the tab *Response* when viewing the details of the specific challenge. Specify the photo resolution (original, high, medium, or low) and when to share the photo submission on the News Feed and gallery (on submission, on approval, or on manual sharing).

### Video Challenge
Ask members to enter a video with desired characteristics. Edit the response settings for the video challenge under the tab *Response* when viewing the details of the specific challenge. Specify the limit for the video size and when to share the video submission on the News Feed and gallery (on submission, on approval, or on manual sharing).

### Survey Challenge
Use to quiz or survey members. Specify the type of survey challenge under the tab *Response*. The **numeric** question type prompts the member for a numerical answer. You can set the correct answer to be any answer, a specific number, or a range of numbers. The **text** question type prompts the member for a written response. You can set the maximum number of characters allowed in the response and the criteria for a correct response, either based on content (if the response matches exactly, contains, or starts with the answer) or length of the response. The **rating** question type prompts the member to respond with a rating between 1 and 5 stars. You can set the correct response to be any answer (default), a specific value, or anywhere in a range of values. The **multiple choice** question type prompts the member to choose a response from preset options. You can set the correct response to be any answer, a specific answer, or a range of answers.

### Facebook Challenge

## Challenge Settings
### Challenge Awards
Use challenge awards to incentivize members to participate in challenges and/or keep track of overall engagement of members. Use the Programs | Member Metrics screen to define the types of awards. Awards are used to redeem rewards (such as products), level up to a higher tier, and privately measure member activities. In addition to awards that are viewable to the member, such as points, it is also be valuable to set up metrics which may not be visible to the member, such as visits.

### Challenge Limits
Use challenge limits to control the number of times and how often members are allowed to enter a challenge. Edit challenge limits on the Challenge | More Settings screen. Specify the total maximum submissions for all members, the maximum submissions for each individual member, and the minimum amount of time between submissions.

## Responding to Challenge Submissions

View all challenge submissions under Challenge | Challenge Responses. You can comment on any challenge submission. You can choose to change the setting of a challenge to **auto approve** to automatically approve the submissions for that challenge. A challenge response has the status **submitted** if it has not been received but neither accepted nor rejected. The status **approved** indicates that either the challenge utilizes the auto approve feature or that the submission has been manually approved. The status **rejected** indicates that the submission is ineligible to receive the challenge award. You must manually reject a submission. You can add a message to the member regarding the rejection and give him/her the opportunity to re-enter the challenge. The status **returned** indicates that the submission was rejected but the member has the opportunity to re-enter the challenge.
